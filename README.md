# i3-screenshot-mode

A nice small helper program for creating screenshots in i3. 

It first asks what kind of screenshots you want:
  - Selection
  - Active window
  - Active monitor
  - All monitors

When you've selected the type, the screenshot is saved in the clipboard for pasting.
It then asks if you want to save it to the disk (~/Pictures)
